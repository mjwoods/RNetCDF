   Memory buffers for R and (optionally) C arrays are allocated by R_nc_c2r_init;
   the C to R conversion is performed by R_nc_c2r, and memory is freed by R.
   Argument io is a pointer to an existing R_nc_buf (must not be NULL).
   The result of R_nc_c2r_init is a pointer to the C buffer used for netcdf functions,
   which may be specified by argument cbuf or internally allocated if cbuf is NULL.
   The number and lengths of netcdf dimensions are ndim and xdim (C-order).
   The special case ndims < 0 gives a vector (no dim attribute) of length xdim[0].
   If fitnum is true (non-zero), rv is the smallest compatible R numeric type,
     otherwise rv is double precision.
   If rawchar is true, NC_CHAR is returned to R as raw bytes, otherwise
     all elements in the fastest-varying dimension are combined into R strings.
   Elements are set to missing if they equal the fill value.
   Unpacking is performed if either scale or add are not NULL.
