Version 1.9-1, 2017-10-04
  * Allow multiple NA values in count argument of var.get.nc/var.put.nc,
    so that corresponding dimensions are read/written to their defined length.
  * Fix support for OPeNDAP (if enabled by the netcdf library)
  * Build Windows packages with netcdf4 library
    - Enable OPeNDAP in Win64
    - Disable OPeNDAP in Win32, because it causes RNetCDF to crash
    - Thanks to Jeroen Ooms for giving us https://github.com/rwinlib/netcdf!
  * Register C routines for efficient access by R

Version 1.8-2, 2016-02-21
  * Add support for POSIXct timestamps to utcal.nc and utinvcal.nc.
  * Use nc-config by default in configure to find netcdf build settings.
  * Allow customisation of configure by variables CPPFLAGS, LDFLAGS and LIBS,
    and remove the following options: --with-netcdf-include, --with-netcdf-lib,
     --with-hdf5-lib, --with-udunits-include, --with-udunits-lib.

Version 1.7-3, 2015-05-09
  * Support reading/writing NC_CHAR as vectors of raw bytes
  * Avoid intermediate copies of array data when possible
  * Fix memory errors reported by valgrind for udunits2 calendar functions.
  * Support compilation with udunits.h inside a udunits2 sub-directory.
  * Add udunits data files to source package to ensure they can be found
    when building binary packages for Windows and Mac.

  * configure adds tests for extra libraries used by netcdf4 on some systems.
  * Avoid repeated zeroing of character arrays in C interface.

Version 1.5.0-1, 2010-12-30
  * Add new modes (large, prefill, share) to nc_open and nc_create.
  * Avoid unnecessary switching of define and data modes in C library
    to prevent unwanted data movement within a file.
  * configure script accepts optional path for hdf5 (for netcdf4 library).
  * Added basic functional tests of package.
