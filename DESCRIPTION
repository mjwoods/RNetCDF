Maintainer: Milton Woods <mwoods@users.r-forge.r-project.org>
Depends: R (>= 2.5.0)
SystemRequirements: netcdf (>= 3.6.0), udunits (>= 1.11.7) or udunits2 (>= 2.1.22)
Description: RNetCDF allows reading and writing of files in the NetCDF format
  designed by Unidata for array-oriented scientific data and descriptions.
  The R interface is closely based on the C API of the NetCDF library,
  and it includes calendar conversions from the Unidata UDUNITS library.
  The current implementation supports all operations on NetCDF datasets
  in classic and 64-bit offset file formats, and NetCDF4-classic format
  is supported for reading and modification of existing files.
