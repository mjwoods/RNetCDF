Description: This package allows reading and writing of files in the NetCDF format,
  which was designed by Unidata for array-oriented scientific data and descriptions.
  The R interface is closely based on the C API of the NetCDF library,
  and it includes calendar conversions from the Unidata UDUNITS library.
  The current implementation supports NetCDF3 and NetCDF4-classic files.
