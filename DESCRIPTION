Depends: R (>= 2.5.0)
SystemRequirements: netcdf udunits-2
Description: An interface to the NetCDF file format designed by Unidata
  for efficient storage of array-oriented scientific data and descriptions.
  The R interface is closely based on the C API of the NetCDF library,
  and it includes calendar conversions from the Unidata UDUNITS library.
  The current implementation supports all operations on NetCDF datasets
  in classic and 64-bit offset file formats, and NetCDF4-classic format
  is supported for reading and modification of existing files.
