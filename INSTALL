This file describes the command line arguments which can be passed during
installation of the RNetCDF package and gives some further hints.


Software Requirements
=====================

NetCDF library version 3.6.0 or greater (64-bit file support).

UDUNITS library either version 1 or 2.1 or greater. RNetCDF uses however
only the version 1 calendar functions.

If the NetCDF library (version 4) is linked against HDF5, the HDF5 library
must be included in the search path, optionally with the configure argument
"--with-hdf5-lib=DIR".

If using Fink on Mac OS X, be sure that the corresponding R version (either
i386 or x86_64) is used (R32 or R64). Compiling with R64 against i386 will
most likely lead to runtime errors.


R CMD INSTALL Options
=====================

--with-netcdf-include=DIR    location of netcdf header files
--with-netcdf-lib=DIR        location of netcdf libraries
--with-udunits-include=DIR   location of udunits header files
--with-udunits-lib=DIR       location of udunits libraries 
--with-hdf5-lib=DIR          location of hdf5 libraries (if installed)


R CMD INSTALL Example
=====================

R CMD INSTALL --configure-args="--with-netcdf-include='/sw/include' \
    --with-netcdf-lib='/sw/lib'" RNetCDF_1.7-2.tar.gz


LD_LIBRARY_PATH
===============

If a runtime error happens, you might need to set or modify the environment
variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH with the directories where the NetCDF and/or UDUNITS
and/or HDF5 libraries are located (especially for non-standard installations):

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/sw/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH


R CMD check Example
===================

R CMD check --install-args="--configure-args='--with-netcdf-include=/sw/include \
--with-netcdf-lib=/sw/lib'" RNetCDF_1.7-2.tar.gz


Time units
==========

Common udunits databases are distributed with RNetCDF, and these are used
by default when RNetCDF is loaded by R. However, a different units database
may be used by specifying the appropriate file in environment variables
UDUNITS2_XML_PATH (udunits2) or UDUNITS_PATH (udunits1).
